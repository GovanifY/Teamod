# Teamod 2
Teamod is a hacking/fun tool originally written in C# by SoraikoSan
w/ the help and infos of several others hackers(including me)
As Sorai's stopping the devlopment, I putted it on my GitHub and
will work on it when I'll feel like it(got some ideas to improve this
like recoding it using gcc and makefiles.
